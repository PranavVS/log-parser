Parse the logs: Takes the file content as string.
Seperate each log entry as an array:
    For this simply seperate the each line.
For each log:
    Only allow the logs  with log level as errors and warn
    if read log is empty simply skip it.
    get the log level.
    check if the log level is error or warn if not then skip the log entry.
    Extract remaining required fields such as timestamp, transactionId,  error-message.
return the extracted data.
